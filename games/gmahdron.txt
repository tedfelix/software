Gamma Hedron

Use the number keys to move your ship (*).  2 is up, 4 is left, 6 is right,
and 8 is down.  The space bar fires in the direction you are moving.
Try to shoot down the enemy (O) who will fill the screen with blinking
radiation.

This game is hilariously random.

Note that you just need to hit a capital O to get a point.  Since there
are frequently O's left on the screen due to bugs, this is pretty easy.
